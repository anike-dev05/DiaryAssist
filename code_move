To identify the causal effect of each variable on the bad rate change in your credit card analytics data, you can use causal inference methods. One popular approach is the Difference-in-Differences (DiD) method. Here's a conceptual code outline using Python and the `causalnex` library for DiD analysis:

```python
from causalnex.structure import StructureModel
from causalnex.inference import InferenceEngine
from causalnex.structure.notears import from_pandas
from causalnex.discretiser import Discretiser
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

# Load your credit card analytics data into a DataFrame
data = pd.read_csv("credit_card_data.csv")

# Preprocess data: handle missing values, encode categorical variables, etc.
# For example, encode categorical variables
label_encoder = LabelEncoder()
data['encoded_categorical_var'] = label_encoder.fit_transform(data['categorical_var'])

# Create a StructureModel and learn the structure of causal relationships
sm = from_pandas(data)

# Discretise continuous variables if needed
discretised_data = Discretiser(method="equalwidth").transform(data[['continuous_var']])

# Add the discretised variables to the structure model
sm.add_nodes_from(discretised_data.columns)
sm.add_edges_from([(col, "bad_rate") for col in discretised_data.columns])

# Perform causal inference
ie = InferenceEngine(sm)
# Here you can query for the causal effect of each variable on the bad rate change
causal_effects = ie.query()

# Print the causal effects
print("Causal effects on bad rate change:")
for variable, effect in causal_effects.items():
    print(f"{variable}: {effect}")
```

This code outlines how you can use the `causalnex` library to perform causal inference and estimate the causal effect of each variable on the bad rate change. Make sure to preprocess your data appropriately and handle any necessary transformations before applying the causal inference techniques. Adjustments may be needed based on your specific data and requirements.
